The primary goal of this research is to study the quality of the sentiment analysis (SA) of impressions about Saudi cruises, as a first event, by creating datasets from three selected social media platforms (Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter). The outcome of this study will help in understanding opinions of passengers and viewers about their first Saudi cruise experiences by analyzing their feelings from social media posts. After cleaning, this experiment contains 1200 samples. The data was classified into positive or negative classes using the choice of machine learning algorithms, such as multilayer perceptron (MLP), naıve bayes (NB), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and voting. The results show the highest classification accuracy for the RF algorithm, as it achieved 100% accuracy with over-sampled data from Snapchat using both test options. The algorithms were compared among the three different datasets. All algorithms achieved a high level of accuracy. Hence, the results show that 80% of the sentiments were positive while 20% were negative. © 2022, The Author(s)."",Article,""Final"",""All Open Access, Gold, Green"",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125304858";

We then analyze the network properties in conjunction with the word scores by comparing with null models to separate the effects of the network structure and the score distribution. Neutral words are found to be dominant and most words, regardless of polarity, tend to co-occur with neutral words. We do not observe any score homophily among positive and negative words. However, when we perform network backboning, community detection results in word groupings with meaningful narratives, and the happiness scores of the words in each group correspond to its respective theme. Thus, although we observe no clear relationship between happiness scores and co-occurrence at the node or edge level, a community-centric approach can isolate themes of competing sentiments in a corpus. © 2022, The Author(s)."",Article,""Final"",""All Open Access, Gold, Green"",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124939698";;;;

Many problems, such as sentiment analysis, image tagging, and location prediction have been studied on Twitter data. Much of the prior work that addresses these problems within the context of Twitter focuses on a subset of the types of data available, e.g. only text, or text and image. However, a tweet can have several additional components, such as the location and the author, that can also provide useful information for machine learning tasks. In this work, we explore the problem of jointly modeling several tweet components in a common embedding space via task-agnostic representation learning, which can then be used to tackle various machine learning applications. To address this problem, we propose a deep neural network framework that combines text, image, and graph representations to learn joint embeddings for 5 tweet components: body, hashtags, images, user, and location. In our experiments, we use a large dataset of tweets to learn a joint embedding model and use it in multiple tasks to evaluate its performance vs. state-of-the-art baselines specific to each task. Our results show that our proposed generic method has similar or superior performance to specialized application-specific approaches, including accuracy of 52.43% vs. 48.88% for location prediction and recall of up to 15.93% vs. 12.12% for hashtag recommendation. © 2022, The Author(s)."",Article,""Final"",""All Open Access, Gold"",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124827436";;;;

Consequently, analysing online conversations, for example, to predict election outcomes, is becoming a popular and challenging research area.

Real-time analysis of social media can provide valuable feedback and insights to both politicians and news agencies. In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of a system for tracking and analysing social media. The SocMINT system provides an easy-to-use, visual dashboard to monitor the discussion on specific topics, to capture trends in communities and, by iteratively applying multidimensional data analysis and filtering, to deeply analyse posts and influencers. SocMINT aggregates data from multiple social sources and performs sentiment analysis on textual, visual and mixed content via a specifically designed neural network architecture. The system was applied in a real context by administrative staff of a political party to effectively analyse candidates’ political communication on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter and the related online community reactions and discussion.

The study addresses a call for an application of big data and text mining in different fields of research, as well as proposes more objective research methods in studies on food consumption. There is a growing interest in understanding consumer choices for foods which are caused by the predominant contribution of the food industry to climate change. So far, customer attitudes towards organic food have been studied mostly with self-reported methods, such as questionnaires and interviews, which have many limitations. Therefore, in the present study, we used big data and text mining techniques as more objective methods to analyze the public attitude about organic foods. A total of 43,724 Twitter posts were extracted with streaming Application Programming Interface (API). Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm was applied for topic modeling. A test of topic significance was performed to evaluate the quality of the topics. Public sentiment was analyzed based on the NRC emotion lexicon by utilizing Syuzhet package. Topic modeling results showed that people discuss on variety of themes related to organic foods such as plant-based diet, saving the planet, organic farming and standardization, authenticity, and food delivery, etc. Sentiment analysis results suggest that people view organic foods positively, though there are also people who are skeptical about the claims that organic foods are natural and free from chemicals and pesticides. The study contributes to the field of consumer behavior by implementing research methods grounded in text mining and big data. The study contributes also to the advancement of research in the field of sustainable food consumption by providing a fresh perspective on public attitude toward organic foods, filling the gaps in existing literature and research. © 2021, The Author(s)."",Article,""Final"",""All Open Access, Gold, Green"",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122543553";;;;;;;

One relevant application of data analysis in football is forecasting, which relies on understanding and accurately modelling the process of a match. The present paper tackles two neglected facets of forecasting in football: Forecasts on the total number of goals and in-play forecasting (forecasts based on within-match information). Sentiment analysis techniques were used to extract the information reflected in almost two million tweets from more than 400 Premier League matches. By means of wordclouds and timely analysis of several tweet-based features, the Twitter communication over the full course of matches and shortly before and after goals was visualized and systematically analysed. Moreover, several forecasting models including a random forest model have been used to obtain in-play forecasts. Results suggest that in-play forecasting of goals is highly challenging, and in-play information does not improve forecasting accuracy. An additional analysis of goals from more than 30,000 matches from the main European football leagues supports the notion that the predictive value of in-play information is highly limited compared to pre-game information. This is a relevant result for coaches, match analysts and broadcasters who should not overestimate the value of in-play information. The present study also sheds light on how the perception and behaviour of Twitter users change over the course of a football match. A main result is that the sentiment of Twitter users decreases when the match progresses, which might be caused by an unjustified high expectation of football fans before the match. © 2021, The Author(s)."",Article,""Final"",""All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green"",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122010136";;;;;;;

Five trending topics related to the COVID-19 pandemic were selected for the study, with Spanish as the target language. To carry out the discovery of virality patterns, we applied opinion mining techniques that enable us to structure the information based on the polarity of the messages and the emotions they contain. After transforming the information from an unstructured textual representation to a structured one, data mining techniques were applied, specifically association rules mining. Message patterns with the highest virality (high shares and high likes), and at the same time the most relevant characteristics of the patterns with less impact were extracted. After an exhaustive analysis of the most relevant non-redundant rules, it can be concluded that messages with a high-negative polarity and a very high emotional charge, especially emotions that have intensified with the COVID-19 pandemic, such as fear, sadness, anger and surprise are more likely to go viral in social media. By contrast, messages with little news coverage in the media, few authors, and the absence of surprise are relevant features when it comes to seeing messages with very low dissemination in social media. © 2022 The Authors"",Article,""Final"",""All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green"",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125238315";;;;

Evaluating Arabic idioms that do not follow a conventional linguistic framework, such as contem-porary standard Arabic (MSA), complicates an incredibly difficult procedure. Here, we define a novel lexical sentiment analysis approach for studying Arabic language tweets (TTs) from special-ized digital media platforms. Many elements comprising emoji, intensifiers, negations, and other nonstandard expressions such as supplications, proverbs, and interjections are incorporated into the MULDASA algorithm to enhance the precision of opinion classifications. Root words in mul-tidialectal sentiment LX are associated with emotions found in the content under study via a simple stemming procedure. Furthermore, a feature–sentiment correlation procedure is incorporated into the proposed technique to exclude viewpoints expressed that seem to be irrelevant to the area of concern. As part of our research into Saudi Arabian employability, we compiled a large sample of TTs in 6 different Arabic dialects. This research shows that this sentiment categorization method is useful, and that using all of the characteristics listed earlier improves the ability to accurately clas-sify people’s feelings. The classification accuracy of the proposed algorithm improved from 83.84% to 89.80%.

One of the most popular social media sites for providing public sentiment towards events that occurred during the COVID-19 period is Twitter. This is because Twitter posts are short and constantly being generated. This paper presents a deep learning approach for sentiment analysis of Twitter data related to COVID-19 reviews. The proposed algorithm is based on an LSTM-RNN-based network and enhanced featured weighting by attention layers. This algorithm uses an enhanced feature transformation framework via the attention mechanism. A total of four class labels (sad, joy, fear, and anger) from publicly available Twitter data posted in the Kaggle database were used in this study. Based on the use of attention layers with the existing LSTM-RNN approach, the proposed deep learning approach significantly improved the performance metrics, with an increase of 20% in accuracy and 10% to 12% in precision but only 12–13% in recall as compared with the current approaches. Out of a total of 179,108 COVID-19-related tweets, tweets with positive, neutral, and negative sentiments were found to account for 45%, 30%, and 25%, respectively.

Previous works focus on extracting more concrete sentimental features of individual objects by introducing saliency detection or instance segmentation into their models, neglecting the interaction among objects. Inspired by the observation that interaction among objects can impact the sentiment of images, we propose the Sentiment Interaction Distillation (SID) Network, which utilizes object sentimental interaction to guide feature learning. Specifically, we first utilize a panoptic segmentation method to obtain objects in images";" then, we propose a sentiment-related edge generation method and employ Graph Convolution Network to aggregate and propagate object relation representation. In addition, we propose a knowledge distillation framework to utilize interaction information guiding global context feature learning, which can avoid noisy features introduced by error propagation and a varying number of objects. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm, e.g., about 1.2% improvement on the Flickr dataset and 1.7% on the most challenging subset of Twitter I.

Nonetheless, today’s abstractive summarization research is limited to testing the models on various types of data, which brings only marginal improvements and does not lead to massive practical employment of the method. In particular, abstractive summarization is not used for social media research, where it would be very useful for opinion and topic mining due to the complications that social media data create for other methods of textual analysis. Of all social media, Reddit is most frequently used for testing new neural models of text summarization on large-scale datasets in English, without further testing on real-world smaller-size data in various languages or from various other platforms. Moreover, for social media, summarizing pools of texts (one-author posts, comment threads, discussion cascades, etc.) may bring crucial results relevant for social studies, which have not yet been tested. However, the existing methods of abstractive summarization are not fine-tuned for social media data and have next-to-never been applied to data from platforms beyond Reddit, nor for comments or non-English user texts. We address these research gaps by fine-tuning the newest Transformer-based neural network models LongFormer and T5 and testing them against BART, and on real-world data from Reddit, with improvements of up to 2%. Then, we apply the best model (fine-tuned T5) to pools of comments from Reddit and assess the similarity of post and comment summarizations. Further, to overcome the 500-token limitation of T5 for analyzing social media pools that are usually bigger, we apply LongFormer Large and T5 Large to pools of tweets from a large-scale discussion on the Charlie Hebdo massacre in three languages and prove that pool summarizations may be used for detecting micro-shifts in agendas of networked discussions. Our results show, however, that additional learning is definitely needed for German and French, as the results for these languages are non-satisfactory, and more fine-tuning is needed even in English for Twitter data. Thus, we show that a ‘one-for-all’ neural-network summarization model is still impossible to reach, while fine-tuning for platform affordances works well. We also show that fine-tuned T5 works best for small-scale social media data, but LongFormer is helpful for larger-scale pool summarizations. © 2022 by the authors.

The dataset is gathered from the “Twitter” package in R along with Twitter API. The main intent of this paper is to understand the public opinion on the recently implemented demonetization policy using the proposed SenDemonNet. Initially, the tweet preprocessing was done, which is intended for cleaning the text data. Then, the feature extraction is performed by Bag of n-grams, TF-IDF, and the word2vec algorithm. The main objective of this work is a weighted feature selection that is developed by the hybrid Forest–Whale Optimization Algorithm (F-WOA) to get the best classification outcome. With these features, the Heuristic Deep Neural Network (HDNN) is adopted for classification, where the proposed FOA and WOA tune the parameter of DNN for reaching the maximum accuracy rate.

The COVID-19 pandemic has shifted most activity being performed remotely using an Internet connection. As a result, the demand for Internet services increased by 50%. This significant rise in the appeal of Internet services needs to be overtaken by a notable increase in the service quality provided by ISPs. Service quality plays a great role for enterprises, including ISPs, in retaining consumer loyalty. Thus, modelling ISPs’ service quality is of great importance. Since a common technique to reveal service quality is a timely and costly pencil survey-based method, this work proposes a framework based on the Sentiment Analysis (SA) of the Twitter dataset to model service quality. The SA involves the majority voting of three machine learning algorithms namely Naïve Bayes, Multinomial Naïve Bayes and Bernoulli Naïve Bayes. Making use of Thaicon’s service quality metrics, this work proposes a formula to generate a rating of service quality accordingly. For the case studies, we examined two ISPs in Indonesia, i.e., By.U and MPWR. The framework successfully extracted the service quality rate of both ISPs, revealing that By.U is better in terms of service quality, as indicated by a service quality rate of 0.71. Meanwhile, MPWR outperforms By.U in terms of customer service. © 2022 by the authors.

Social surveys and also social media can be employed to engage with their com-munities, and these can require sophisticated analysis techniques. This research was focused on carrying out a sentiment analysis from social surveys. Data analysis techniques using RStudio and Python were applied to several open-source datasets, which included the 2018 Social Indicators Survey dataset published by the City of Melbourne (CoM) and the Casey Next short survey 2016 dataset published by the City of Casey (CoC). The qualitative nature of the CoC dataset responses could produce rich insights using sentiment analysis, unlike the quantitative CoM dataset. RStudio analysis created word cloud visualizations and bar charts for sentiment values. These were then used to inform social media analysis via the Twitter application programming interface. The R codes were all integrated within a Shiny application to create a set of user-friendly interactive web apps that generate sentiment analysis both from the historic survey data and more immediately from the Twitter feeds. The web apps were embedded within a website that provides a customisable solution to estimate sentiment for key issues. Global sentiment was also compared between the social media approach and the 2016 survey dataset analysis and showed some correlation, although there are caveats on the use of social media for sentiment analysis. Further refinement of the methodology is required to improve the social media app and to calibrate it against analysis of recent survey data. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Today we consider the huge amount of structured and unstructured data available in the web for a particular subject to get an opinion. The surplus data handling termed as big data requires some new technology to deal with. This paper considers the requirement of sentiment analysis of such huge data for fast processing. Based on fast Fourier transform on temporal intuitionistic fuzzy set generated from text, this algorithm (FFT–TIFS) expedites the sentiment classification. Fourier analysis converts a signal from its time domain to its representation in frequency domain. Such frequency domain algorithm on temporal intuitionistic fuzzy set is used in sentiment analysis for the first time. This algorithm is useful for short Twitter text, document-level as well as sentence-level binary sentiment classification. It is tested on aclImdb, Polarity, MR, Sentiment 140 and CR dataset which gives an average of 80% accuracy. The proposed method shows significant improvement in required time complexity where the method achieves 17 times faster processing in comparison with sequential fuzzy C-means (FCM) method, and again, it is at least 7 times faster than distributed FCM method present in the literature.

Major social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, or Quora face a huge dilemma as a lot of these sites fall victim to spam accounts. These accounts are made to trap unsuspecting genuine users by making them click on malicious links or keep posting redundant posts by using bots. This can greatly impact the experiences that users have on these sites. A lot of time and research has gone into effective ways to detect these forms of spam. Performing sentiment analysis on these posts can help us in solving this problem effectively. The main purpose of this proposed work is to develop a system that can determine whether a tweet is """"spam""""or """"ham""""and evaluate the emotion of the tweet. The extracted features after preprocessing the tweets are classified using various classifiers, namely, decision tree, logistic regression, multinomial naïve Bayes, support vector machine, random forest, and Bernoulli naïve Bayes for spam detection. The stochastic gradient descent, support vector machine, logistic regression, random forest, naïve Bayes, and deep learning methods, namely, simple recurrent neural network (RNN) model, long short-term memory (LSTM) model, bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) model, and 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) model are used for sentiment analysis. The performance of each classifier is analyzed. The classification results showed that the features extracted from the tweets can be satisfactorily used to identify if a certain tweet is spam or not and create a learning model that will associate tweets with a particular sentiment. © 2022 Anisha P Rodrigues et al."",Article,""Final"",""All Open Access, Gold, Green"",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128801595";

As global warming continues to exacerbate sea level rise and extreme weather, governmental authorities and environmental agencies are facing the pressing need of timely and accurate evaluations and predictions of flood risks. Current flood forecasts are generally based on historical measurements of environmental variables at monitoring stations. In recent years, in addition to traditional data sources, large amounts of information related to floods have been made available via social media. Members of the public are constantly and promptly posting information and updates on local environmental phenomena on social media platforms. Despite the growing interest of scholars towards the usage of online data during natural disasters, the majority of studies focus exclusively on social media as a stand-alone data source, while its joint use with other type of information is still unexplored. In this paper we propose to fill this gap by integrat ing traditional historical information on floods with data extracted by Twitter and Google Trends. Our methodology is based on vine copulas, that allow us to capture the dependence structure among the marginals, which are modelled via appropriate time series methods, in a very flexible way.

Therefore, social media posts have become an excellent data source for the field of sentiment analysis. The main contribution of this study is based on the Natural Language Processing method, which is one of the machine learning topics in the literature. Sentiment analysis classification is a solid example for machine learning tasks that belongs to human-machine interaction. It is essential to make the computer understand people emotional situation with classifiers. There are a limited number of Turkish language studies in the literature. Turkish language has different types of linguistic features from English. Since Turkish is an agglutinative language, it is challenging to make sentiment analysis with that language. This paper aims to perform sentiment analysis of several machine learning algorithms on Turkish language datasets that are collected from Twitter. In this research, besides using public dataset that belongs to Beyaz (2021) to get more general results, another dataset is created to understand the impact of the pandemic on people and to learn about public opinions. Therefore, a custom dataset, namely, SentimentSet (Balli 2021), was created, consisting of Turkish tweets that were filtered with words such as pandemic and corona by manually marking as positive, negative, or neutral. Besides, SentimentSet could be used in future researches as benchmark dataset. Results show classification accuracy of not only up to ∼87% with test data from datasets of both datasets and trained models, but also up to ∼84% with small """"Sample Test Data""""generated by the same methods as SentimentSet dataset.

Text classification is the process of assigning one or more pre-defined categories to text according to its content. Tweets are short, and the short text does not have enough contextual information, which is part of the challenge in their classification. Adding to the challenge is the increase in ambiguity since the diacritical marking is not explicitly specified in most Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) texts. Not to mention the Arabic tweets are known to contain fused text of MSA and dialectal Arabic. In this paper, we propose a scheme to classify the textual tweets in the Arabic language based on its linguistic characteristics and content into five different categories. We explore two different textual representations: word embedding using Word2vec and stemmed text with term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf). We tested three different classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), and Random Forest (RF). All the classifiers had their hyperparameters tuned. We collected and manually annotated a dataset of approximately 35,600 Arabic tweets for the experiments. Statistically, the RF and the SVM with radial basis function (RBF) kernel performed equally well when used with stemming and tf-idf, achieving macro-F1 scores ranging between 98.09% and 98.14%.

Despite a significant decrease in the number of nodes and edges in the emoji co-occurrence network, the average degree of the network increased from 34 to 39.8, indicating that the diversity of emoji usage increased. Most interestingly, we found that male users were more inclined towards using regular textual language with fewer emojis after the pandemic, suggesting that during public crises, male groups appeared to control their emotional display. In summary, the COVID-19 pandemic remarkably impacted individual sentiments, and the normal pattern of emoji usage tends to change significantly following a public emergency. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."",Article,""Article in Press"",""All Open Access, Bronze, Green"",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126799282";;

They are constantly posting their satisfaction or dissatisfaction over the COVID-19 situation at their location of interest. Therefore, understanding location-oriented sentiments about this situation is of prime importance for political leaders, and strategic decision-makers. To this end, we present a new fully automated algorithm based on artificial intelligence (AI), for extraction of location-oriented public sentiments on the COVID-19 situation. We designed the proposed system to obtain exhaustive knowledge and insights on social media feeds related to COVID-19 in 110 languages through AI-based translation, sentiment analysis, location entity detection, and decomposition tree analysis. We deployed fully automated algorithm on live Twitter feed from July 15, 2021 and it is still running as of 12 January, 2022. The system was evaluated on a limited dataset between July 15, 2021 to August 10, 2021. During this evaluation timeframe 150,000 tweets were analyzed and our algorithm found that 9,900 tweets contained one or more location entities. In total, 13,220 location entities were detected during the evaluation period, and the rates of average precision and recall rate were 0.901 and 0.967, respectively. As of 12 January, 2022, the proposed solution has detected 43,169 locations using entity recognition. According to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report location intelligence with entity detection, sentiment analysis, and decomposition tree analysis on social media messages related to COVID-19 and has covered the largest set of languages. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

Unwanted messages posted on Twitter may have several goals and the spam tweets can interfere with statistics presented by Twitter mining tools and squander users’ attention.. Since Twitter has achieved a lot of attractiveness through-out the world, the interest towards it by the spammers and malevolent users is also increases. To overcome the spam problems many researchers proposed ideas using machine learning algorithms for the identification of spam messages. Not only the selection of classifiers but also the variegated feature analysis is essential for the identification of irrelevant messages in social networks. The proposed model performs a heterogeneous feature analysis on the twitter data streams for classifying the unsolicited messages using binary and continuous feature extraction with sentiment analysis on social network datasets. The features created are assessed using significant stratagems and the finest features are selected. A classifier model is built using these feature vectors to predict and identify the spam messages in Twitter.

We evaluate whether Watson NLP service can be used to reliably predict infectious disease such as influenza-like illness (ILI) outbreaks using Twitter data during the period of the main influenza season. Watson’s performance is evaluated by computing Pearson correlation between the number of tweets classified by Watson as ILI and the number of ILI occurrences recovered from traditional epidemic surveillance system of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Achieved correlation was 0.55. Furthermore, a 12 week discrepancy was found between peak occurrences of ILI predicted by Watson and CDC reported data. Additionally, we developed a scoring method for ILI prediction from Twitter posts using a simple formula with the ability to predict ILI two weeks ahead of CDC reported ILI data. The method uses Watson’s sentiment and emotion scores together with identified ILI features to analyze influenza-related posts in real time. Due to Watson's high computational costs of sentiment and emotion analysis, we tested if machine learning approach can be used to predict influenza using only identified ILI keywords as influenza predictors. All three evaluated methods (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-NN), achieved overall accuracy of ~68.2% and 97.5% respectively, when Watson and the developed formula are used as medical experts. The obtained results suggest that data found within social media can be used to supplement the traditional surveillance of influenza outbreaks with the help of intelligent computations. © 2022, Periodicals of Engineering and Natural Sciences.

As of 23 August 2021, more than 20 vaccines have been approved by the World Health Organization (WHO), bringing light to people besieged by the pandemic. The global rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine has sparked much discussion on social media platforms, such as the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine. However, there has not been much systematic analysis of public opinion on the COVID-19 vaccine. In this study, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the discussions related to the COVID-19 vaccine on Twitter. We analyze the hot topics discussed by people and the corresponding emotional polarity from the perspective of countries and vaccine brands. The results show that most people trust the effectiveness of vaccines and are willing to get vaccinated. In contrast, negative tweets tended to be associated with news reports of post-vaccination deaths, vaccine shortages, and post-injection side effects. Overall, this study uses popular Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies to mine people’s opinions on the COVID-19 vaccine on social media and objectively analyze and visualize them.

Accurate forecasting of stock prices can result in huge profits to the investors. The prediction of stock market is a tedious process which involves different factors such as politics, economic growth, interest rate, etc. The recent development of social networking sites enables the investors to discuss the stock market details such as profit, future stock prices, etc. The proper identification of sentiments posted by the investors in social media can be utilized for predicting the upcoming stock prices. With this motivation, this paper focuses on the design of effective stock price prediction using dragonfly algorithm (DFA) based deep belief network (DBN) model. The DFA-DBN technique aims to properly determine the sentiments of the investors from Twitter data and forecast future stock prices. From Twitter data, the DFA-DBN technique attempts to accurately determine the sentiments of investors, as well as predict future stock prices. For accurate stock price prediction, the proposed DFA-DBN model includes the development of a DBN model. The proposed DFA-DBN model involves the design of DBN model for accurate prediction of stock prices. Besides, the hyperparameter tuning of the DBN technique is performed by utilize of DFA and thereby boosts the overall prediction performance. For validating the supremacy of the DFA-DBN model, a comprehensive experimental analysis takes place and the results demonstrate the accurate prediction of stock prices. A predicted DFA-DBN algorithm with a higher accuracy of 94.97 percent is available. On the basis of the data in the tables and figures above, the DFA-DBN approach has been demonstrated to be an effective instrument for anticipating stock price fluctuations. © 2022, Tech Science Press.

It is associated with the analysis of textual data generated by social media that can be easily accessed, obtained, and analyzed. With the emergence of COVID-19, most published studies related to COVID-19's conspiracy theories were surveys on the people's sentiments and opinions and studied the impact of the pandemic on their lives. Just a few studies utilized sentiment analysis of social media using a machine learning approach. These studies focused more on sentiment analysis of Twitter tweets in the English language and did not pay more attention to other languages such as Arabic. This study proposes a machine learning model to analyze the Arabic tweets from Twitter. In this model, we apply Word2Vec for word embedding which formed the main source of features. Two pretrained continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) models are investigated, and Naïve Bayes was used as a baseline classifier. Several single-based and ensemble-based machine learning classifiers have been used with and without SMOTE (synthetic minority oversampling technique). The experimental results show that applying word embedding with an ensemble and SMOTE achieved good improvement on average of F1 score compared to the baseline classifier and other classifiers (single-based and ensemble-based) without SMOTE. © 2022 Abdullah Al-Hashedi et al."",Article,""Final"",""All Open Access, Gold"",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123526444";;

In particular, Twitter has a large number of geotagged tweets that make the analysis of sentiments across time and space possible. This study performs volume analysis and sentiment analysis using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and text mining over two datasets collected for different periods. To increase the adequacy and efficacy of the sentiment analysis, a hybrid feature engineering approach is proposed that elevates the performance of machine learning models. Geotagged tweets are used for volume analysis indicating that the highest number of tweets is originated from India, the US, the UK, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Analysis of positive and negative tweets reveals that negative tweets are mostly originated from India and the US. On the contrary, positive tweets belong to Pakistan and Afghanistan. LDA is used for topic modeling on two datasets containing tweets about the current situation after the Taliban take control of Afghanistan. Topics extracted through LDA suggest that majority of the Afghanistan people seem satisfied with the Taliban’s takeover while the topics from negative tweets reveal that issues discussed in negative tweets are related to the US concerns in Afghanistan.

This affects their emotions and motivates them to buy or sell shares. Financial sentiment analysis allows us to understand the effect of social media reactions and emotions on the stock market and vice versa. In this research, we analyse Twitter data and important worldwide financial indices to answer the following question: How does the polarity generated by Twitter posts influence the behaviour of financial indices during pandemics? This study is based on the financial sentiment analysis of influential Twitter accounts and its relationship with the behaviour of important financial indices. To carry out this analysis, we used fundamental and technical financial analysis combined with a lexicon-based approach on financial Twitter accounts. We calculated the correlations between the polarities of financial market indicators and posts on Twitter by applying a date shift on tweets. In addition, correlations were identified days before and after the existing posts on financial Twitter accounts. Our findings show that the markets reacted 0 to 10 days after the information was shared and disseminated on Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic and 0 to 15 days after the information was shared and disseminated on Twitter during the H1N1 pandemic. We identified an inverse relationship: Twitter accounts presented reactions to financial market behaviour within a period of 0 to 11 days during the H1N1 pandemic and 0 to 6 days during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also found that our method is better at detecting highly shifted correlations by using SenticNet compared with other lexicons. With SenticNet, it is possible to detect correlations even on the same day as the Twitter posts. The most influential Twitter accounts during the period of the pandemic were The New York Times, Bloomberg, CNN News and Investing.com, presenting a very high correlation between sentiments on Twitter and stock market behaviour. The combination of a lexicon-based approach is enhanced by a shifted correlation analysis, as latent or hidden correlations can be found in data. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature."",Article,""Final"",""All Open Access, Bronze"",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099860547";;;;;
