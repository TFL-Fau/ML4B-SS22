### Explanation of the functionality
</div>
We analyzed the tweets of many of politicians of the german bundestag and shared the results on our streamlit app.
We analyzed the tweets on their sentiments, emotions and did a topic analysis.
We trained a machine learning algorithm on the emotion analysis data. If we give the algorithm a sentence he will predict the emotions in it.
Afterwards we made a comparison between 6 algorithms, to check where we can get the best results.
